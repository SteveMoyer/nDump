The goal of this project is to make it easier to manage and spin up development and functional test datasets as an alternative to trying to use difficult to version database backups or sql files.

In the process of creating these data sets you will have to understand the structure of your database(s).

Overview:
	Generate csv files of all data needed to run an app
	Modify csv files(if necessary)
	Convert csv files to sql files
	run csv files against empty(or to be emptied) database
	run app against filled database

Task: Getting to CSV
	Step 1:
		Option 1. Export an entire database(only reasonable for small database)
		Option 2. Build up a dataset from scratch and export to CSV(if only most apps worked starting with no data)
		Option 3. Define and script a workable set of data from a database directly to csv(most likely with non-new databases)
			Incrementally build filter scripts to decide what data you want in your data set

	Step 2:
		Add csv files to version control

Task: Populate Database from Csv files
    Step 1 Convert Csv Files to Sql
	Step 2 Execute sql against database

Task: Add Additional Data
	Step 1:	
		Option 1: Load the data and add additional data through your application
		Option 2: Enter additional data directly into the csv files

	Step 2:
		Commit changes to version control

Task: Run Functional Tests
	Step 1: Reset database to stable data set state
	Step 2: Run functional tests
